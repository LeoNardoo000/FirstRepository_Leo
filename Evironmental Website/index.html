            <h1>All About Environmental Health</h1>
            <p>Environmental health is all about how our surroundings influence our well-being. It's a critical part of public health that focuses on the relationships between people and their environment. Here are some key aspects:

                Air Quality: Clean air is vital for our health. Poor air quality can lead to respiratory issues like asthma, bronchitis, and even heart disease. Industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and burning fossil fuels are significant contributors to air pollution.
                
                Water Quality: Safe, clean water is essential for drinking, cooking, and sanitation. Contaminants like heavy metals, bacteria, and pesticides can cause serious health problems. Ensuring access to clean water is a fundamental aspect of environmental health.
                
                Food Safety: Contaminants in food, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and pathogens, can lead to foodborne illnesses. Environmental health practices help ensure that food production and processing are safe, from farm to table.
                
                Waste Management: Proper disposal and treatment of waste prevent the spread of disease and reduce environmental contamination. This includes everything from household garbage to hazardous industrial waste.
                
                Chemical Safety: Exposure to harmful chemicals in the environment, such as lead, mercury, and various industrial chemicals, can cause acute or chronic health effects. Regulations and safety practices help minimize these risks.
                
                Climate Change: Changes in climate patterns affect the environment and human health. Increased temperatures, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events can lead to health issues such as heat-related illnesses, vector-borne diseases, and mental health challenges.
